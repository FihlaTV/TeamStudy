##Goal
The goal of TeamStudy is to have a platform that will allow for easy formation of study groups for students. They will be able to manually join a study group for a particular class or have the system match them with others. The groups them selves will have unique functionalities that will help students succeed, such as: Setting important date reminders, booking meetings with TAs/Profs and document distribution. There will also be a live chat to ask pertinent questions to the right people.
